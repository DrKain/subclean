## Download

Downloads for Windows, Linux and Mac can be found on the [releases](https://github.com/DrKain/subclean/releases) page.  
Alternatively, you can install using NodeJS:

```sh
npm install -g subclean
```

Or you can build it yourself: `npm install && npm run build`

## Usage

If using Bazarr, please see the [wiki page](https://github.com/DrKain/subclean/wiki/Bazarr).

```
Usage: subclean [options]
Single: subclean subtitle.srt -w
Bulk: subclean --sweep "path/to/media"

Options:
  -i, --input      The file you want to clean
  -o, --output     Where to write the cleaned file (defaults to input)
  -w, --overwrite  Overwrite the output file if it already exists     
  -c, --clean      Delete the input file before writing the output    
  -v, --version    Display current version
  -n, --no-check   Don't check for a new package version
  -s, --silent     Silent mode. Nothing logged to console
      --update     Download the latest filters from GitHub
                   This will not update subclean, only the filters!

      --sweep      Bulk subtitle cleaning. Searches for subtitles
                   in multiple directories (and sub-directories)
                   This will enable --overwrite!

      v- You likely do not need to use these -v

      --depth      How many sub-directories to look when sweep cleaning
      --debug      Display extra debugging information
      --help       Show the text you're reading now
      --ne         No Empty (nodes). Deletes empty nodes after cleaning.
      --testing    Testing mode. Will not modify files.
      --uf         Use Filter: internal or appdata
```

## üßπ Bulk Cleaning

Scans for subtitle files and cleans them one by one.  
Depth is optional. Take a look at the [depth map](https://github.com/DrKain/subclean/wiki/Bulk-Cleaning#depth-map) for a visual guide on what depth to use.

```sh
subclean --sweep "path/to/media" --depth 5
// or
subclean --sweep
```

## üìù Filters

When you run `subclean --update` new filters will be downloaded from GitHub.
The location of these files may differ depending on what OS you are using.
If the downloaded filters do not exist or can not be accessed the internal filters will be used instead

You can create `custom.json` alongside the downloaded filters. Subclean will automatically load this and apply it when cleaning. You can verify this is being loaded by running `subclean --debug`. You should see a message similar to `Loaded n filters from custom`
